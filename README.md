Rotary Encoders for FGFS
==================

This uses (up to) 3 Rotary Encoders (RE) and a Raspberry Pi Pico (Pico) to connect the REs to FlightGear Flight Simulator as a Pitch Trimwheel and HDG and CRS adjusters.

A configuration file is provided for FGFS, and no additional configuration is required.

The software will work fine with any or all the REs connected.
