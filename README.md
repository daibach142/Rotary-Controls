Trimwheel for FGFS
==================

This uses a Rotary Encoder (RE) and a Raspberry Pi Pico (Pico) to connect the RE to FlightGear Flight Simulator as a Pitch Trimwheel.

A configuration file for the Trimwheel is provided for FGFS, and no additional configuration is required.

The Pico has lots of expansion capabilities, and could easily accommodate another RE perhaps for roll trim, and maybe some switches.
